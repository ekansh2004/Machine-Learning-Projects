period and a h stimulation period the gastric juice was obtained in min portions via stomach tube stimulation was effected by mugkgh PG via drip infusion the friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the wilcoxon test pairdifferences rank the results show that sch and sch OX were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume as compared with PL it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam CT sch and sch oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first min of basal secretion none of the three AS S9 was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid although both sch preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values during the basal secretion period all three test S9 had an inhibiting action on acid concentration but none of them had a significant effect during the

lysophosphoglyceride demonstrable in the SVs from either source and its low levels did not increase as a result of chemical or electircal stimulation in each case there was a close similarity of the phospholipid distributions in the vesicles taken from control and stimulated samples control experiments indicated extensive decreases in the acetylcholine content of the LDV from the stimulated electric organ and smaller decreases in the acetylcholine content of the SVs from stimulated crude synaptosomal fractions these fractions were found to respire linearly in the presence of mm glucose

phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were determined in fractions d SVs e microsomes and h disrupted synaptosomes the release of neurotransmitter did not significantly enhance the labelling of

nacetylbetadglucosaminidase Hex C2 than normal mice other androgeninducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol mitochondria and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice no significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher GUS content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidasecontaining lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary in NM lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice it appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper F0 with the plasma membrane a similar defect could account for characteristics of the CHS\"\n        ],\n
